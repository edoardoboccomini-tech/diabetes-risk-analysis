# Project Overview
This project explores the impact of non-clinical factors (lifestyle habits and genetics) on the probability of diabetes diagnosis. Using a dataset of 97,297 observations, we deliberately excluded clinical markers (like glucose or insulin levels) to focus on the effects of genetic variables and lifestyle choices.

The analysis was originally developed in R as part of a university project at UNIVPM.

# Key Insights
Activity Dominance: Our models show that consistent physical activity can mitigate the risk of diabetes more effectively than age or a strictly healthy diet alone.

The Age Paradox: Through clustering, we identified that active seniors can maintain a lower risk profile than sedentary younger individuals.

Methodology & Tools
Language: R

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and normalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Correlation matrices and distribution analysis.

Statistical Modeling: 
* Logistic Regression

* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) & QDA

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction

* Hierachical and K-Means Clustering for patient segmentation.

# Dataset
The data used is the Diabetes and Lifestyle Dataset (available on Kaggle), which includes 31 variables covering demographic, lifestyle, and genetic information.
